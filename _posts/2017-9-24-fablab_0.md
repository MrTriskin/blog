# FABO ACADEMY X
## CLASS 0
## Introduction 2 *FabLab*

[Boibee](https://mrtriskin.github.io/)

Fab Lab was born in Center for Bits and Atoms in MIT (Massachussets Institute of Technology), brain storming and creating/DIY fancy things.
Fab labs are a global network of local labs, enabling invention by providing access to tools for
digital fabrication.
Fab labs share an evolving inventory of core capabilities to make (almost) anything, allowing
people and projects to be shared
