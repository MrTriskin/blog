Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....Here comes ***CO2 Laser Cutter!***
<!-- ![Lasers Cutter]() -->

## LASER CUTTING OPERATING THE MACHINE

  - Turn on **the laser cutter**, **the airflow** and **the exhaust filter**.
  - **Insert** a sheet of material.
  - **Focus** the laser head.
  - **Send the file** from PC to the laser cutter.
  - Use laser cutter control panel to **start cutting**.
    `When the machine is ready to cut, it will "bibi"`


## LASERS CUTTER SAFETY
  - Ensure **good ventilation**.
  - Airflow and filter must be **ON**.
  - Only cut **safe material**.
    `using flame test`
  - **NEVER EVER** leave the laser unattended while cutting.
    `no farther than an arm length between u and the machine`

### KERF CALCULATION
  - The laser burns away a portion of material when it **cuts through**.
  - This is known as the laser kerf and ranges from **0.08mm â€“ 1mm** depending on the material type, its thickness and laser settings (power, speed, PPI).
  - To calculate the kerf:

### FASTER SHAPE ENGRAVING
  - When engraving, laser swings **left to right and moves bottom to top**.
  - To avoid smoke stain use **masking tape**.
   `laser settings must be modified`

### PRESS FIT JOINTS
  - **KERF** should be counted.
  - Or you can make a **TRICK**.
