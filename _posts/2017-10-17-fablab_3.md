HAPPY NATIONAL DAY! XD

Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiu....Here comes ***3D SCANNING!***

### DIE SAAT

  It might be great works.
  I used to collect things like leaves, seeds, chick bones...
  This time I wanna scan my seeds collections including peach-kernel, pine-cone and a walnut.
  I will continuously update the post, trying to make fancy works out of them. :D

  PS: This work mainly based on Rhino5, Meshmixer, 3D scanner and da Vinci 1.0 the 3D printer.

### 3D SCANNING NOTES

  - **AVOID** direct sun light when scanning.

  - Using **Structured Light** to make things happen.

  - When connecting two parts in manual mode, man should select **3 feature points** to make things happen.

  - Mesh should be **no more than 20000 surfaces** to be 3D print.

  - [3D Builder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/hardware/mt463353.aspx) is a quick way to check your .stl file and applying small fixings.

### TEST SCANNING

  - A rough scanning of body with [Kinect](http://www.k4w.cn/).

  - A more refined scanning of a Baozi with [EinScan Pro](http://www.shining3d.com/digitizer_detail-4552.html).

  - Combining these two to create a 3D model. :D

### Peach Kernel

  This nut was found inside a peach last year.
  It was a really ripe peach.
  Not tasted well but contained a perfect nut inside it.
  Emmmm...I finally decided to make a necklace from it. XD

  - Peach kernel in real world

  - Then scan it to a Mesh

  - Then make HOLES!!!

  - Printing with da Vinci 1.0

  - After 1h30mins the nut finally came out with supports which is not really hard to remove.

  - After removing thoses surports

  - Although with lots of surports, the back side of the nut is kind of mess. Maybe some smoothing method is needed. QwQ

  - Finally put my No.0 on it. Bravo!!!
