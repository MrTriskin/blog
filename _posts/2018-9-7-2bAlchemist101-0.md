# To be Alchemist 101
## How to set up the environment?

<!-- View [Boibee](https://mrtriskin.github.io/) on GitHub -->

I finally decide to write down some notes about environment setting up, in case some day I might need to set it up on another pc.


For operating system, Linux [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/index_kylin) is suggesed! ( All operations in this blog were based on Ubuntu 16.04)


So, los gehts! :)


### Check the version of CUDA
Before we actually start installing, it's better to check the instance inviroment first. If you do not what CUDA is, [check it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).Ususally CUDA is insalled under **/usr/localcuda/**. Under this address, a **version.txt" file contains the version information. So to check the version of CUDA, in terminal:


`cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt`


### Install Anaconda!!!
[Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer.


Conda is also occupied with [documents](https://conda.io/docs/).Read *environment* part to get familiar with:

    - How to create an environment?


    `conda create --name projname`
    - How to avtive an enviroment?


    `source avtivate projname`
    
### Install Pytorch
