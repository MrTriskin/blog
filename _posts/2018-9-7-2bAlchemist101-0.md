I finally decide to write down some notes about enviroment setting up, in case some day I might need to set it up on another pc.


For operating system, Linux [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/index_kylin) is suggesed! ( All operations in this blog were based on Ubuntu 16.04)

### Check the version of CUDA
Before we actually start installing, it's better to check the instance inviroment first. If you do not what CUDA is, [check it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

See [How to Solder Electronic Components](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/how-to-solder#overview), which contains fundamental details about soldering electronic components.
